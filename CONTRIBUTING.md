# Contribution Guidelines

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [snipe/snipe-it](http://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) repository in the develop branch!

As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch. It makes it much easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time.
